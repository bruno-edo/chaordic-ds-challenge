Chaordic ML Challenge
===================

This repository contains my machine learning solution to the challenge proposed by [Chaordic](https://www.chaordic.com.br/). 

In this challenge we had to find out the **gender** of users, based on their **clickstream** data (in one of the many e-commerces that the company's responsible for), and a **catalog** of products. If you wish to know more about the challenge click [here](https://chaordic.github.io/machinelearning-challenge/).

If you only wish to know how to run the code, and understand what's being done by it, jump to the **Understanding the Code** section of this document.

> **Note:**

> The tools and processes described here were performed under a Windows 7 environment. The code should work on Linux, but it's possible that a few lines of code may have to be changed.

Files

####<i class="icon-file"></i>Notebooks

 - **catalog-treatment**: contains the treatment given to the product's catalog;
 - **data-treatment**: contains the treatment given to the training data and the predictive model utilized;
 - **target-treatment**: contains the treatment given to the training data, so it can be used by the predictive model created;
 - **polished-data-treatment**: same as **data-treatment** file, but comments were added and notebook cells that were confusing/unnecessary were deleted, it also leaves out work done towards models that didn't produce the best results;
 - **polished-target-treatment**: same as **target-treatment** file, but comments were added and notebook cells that were confusing/unnecessary were deleted, it also leaves out work done towards models that didn't produce the best results;

####<i class="icon-file"></i>"Outputs" folder

This folder contain the **outputs** generated by each iteration of the predictive model. Only files generated by runs that were **submitted** for evaluation are contained here.

####<i class="icon-file"></i>CSV files

 - **processed_catalog**: file produced by running the **catalog-treatment** notebook;
 - **target_final_data**: file produced by running the **polished-target-treatment** notebook;
